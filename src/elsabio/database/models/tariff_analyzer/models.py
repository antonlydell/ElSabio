        The part of the `price` that is composed of a fee to the authorities.

    price_outside_validity : decimal.Decimal, default 0
        The price of the component outside of its validity range.

    authority_fee_outside_validity : decimal.Decimal, default 0
        The part of the `price` outside of the validity that represents the fee to the authorities.

    overshoot_limit : decimal.Decimal, default 1.0
        The allowed limit of the comparison meter data serie, subscribed power or connection
        power that overshoot components are calculated against. The default of 1.0 means
        that an overshoot occurs when the meter data exceeds 100 % of the comparison value.

    validity_start : int, default 1
        The start month the tariff component is valid from (inclusive).

    validity_end : int, default 12
        The end month the tariff component is valid until (inclusive).
        `validity_start` > `validity_end` is valid when specifying e.g.
        the range November - March (11 - 3).

    updated_at : datetime.datetime or None
        The timestamp at which the tariff component was last updated (UTC).

    updated_by : uuid.UUID or None
        The ID of the user that last updated the tariff component.

    created_at : datetime.datetime
        The timestamp at which the tariff component was created (UTC).
        Defaults to current timestamp.

    created_by : uuid.UUID or None
        The ID of the user that created the tariff component.
